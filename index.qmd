## About {#about}

I implement combinatorial approaches to analyze differential gene regulation networks with multiomic methods. I earned my Ph.D. in Human Genetics from UCLA in 2025, generating an in vitro and in vivo, multiomic atlas of Ts21 neocortex. I am skilled in computational science, biostatistics, machine learning, neuroscience, genetics and genomics.
